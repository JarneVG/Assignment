    "1. Write down the equations of motion of the lander, as a state-space model, using the states and controls as introduced before, such that we can use it in an optimal control problem. Hint: do not forget to include gravity. The effect of the moon's atmosphere is negligible.\n",

    "   - c. starting and stopping horizontally and in rest, hovering right on/above the surface with zero translational and rotational velocities, and\n",
    "   - d. avoiding the environment, in which you 1) use a circle with a diameter of $5\\text{ m}$ as no-collision model for the lander and 2) model the environment as a set of state bounds and circles, and\n",

    "3. Is your optimal control problem convex? Motivate your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Solve the optimal control problem and discuss the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Formulate a similar optimal control problem, but now 1) with the time duration of the maneuver fixed, equal to two times the duration of the minimum time solution you found in question 3, and 2) with minimal total fuel consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Solve the problem (of question 5) using both a single shooting and a multiple shooting transcription, show the structure of the constraint Jacobian (hint: use \"ocp.spy()\") for both transcriptions and discuss the sparsity pattern, its size,... Is the convergence behavior different for both methods?\n",

    "    - b. consider a sequence of rectangular corridors for the lander to traverse (in order) until reaching its destination, as illustrated in the figure below. (Hint: during first stage the lander is constrained to stay within the first rectangle, at the end of the stage it must be at the edge between the first and the second rectangle, during the second stage it must stay within the second rectangle, etc.) Note that the corridors in the figure are one example of the stages.
